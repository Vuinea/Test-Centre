# Test-Centre

The project we are making is a management system for the test center. 

It is a Webapp that uses a SQLite Database and Flask to allow Students to understand and manage thier appointments and Teachers and administrators to manage tests.

To acomplish this the system integrates with microsoft OAuth to handle logging in and out and integrates with the accomodations spreadsheet to understand which students are allowed extra time
