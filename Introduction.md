# TEST-CENTRE

The project we are making is a management system for Ashbury's test center. 

It is a webapp that works with a database to plan out when students will be taking tests in the test center. 

The database also pulls information about student accommodations from a spreadsheet.

Teachers are able to look up students and enter new students if necessary. For each student, they can assign tests and adjust accommodations. If students miss a test, they can assign a new test.

Test center staff uses the system to view the schedule and record attendence or problems that arise during the test.

Students receive information about their tests via email sent by the system.

Design documention:
1. Start with what the reader needs
2. Write less
3. Write the outline first
4. rubber ducking works for docs too
5. Write readably (use structure, headings, etc)
6. It's not just about documentation
